## Big O Notation
Big O notation is a measurement of effeiciency that determines the time complexity of a function. 3 common notations of this are O(n), O(1) and 0(n^2). There are many more but these are the most common. O(n) is of linear time complexity while O(1) is constant and O(n^2) is quadratic. The most optimal would be the O(1).
