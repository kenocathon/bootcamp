Web App Idea:
Admin page:
An online farmers market that will allow farmers to create their own profile page and 
advertise their products. There will be an admin page where they will have access to a calendar that will be used to schedule pickups from their customers. There will also be an inventory system that will keep them from selling product they do not have. They will also be able to access financial reporting tools in the Admin area. Setup will need to be easy and smooth so that they can be up and running very quickly.

Index:
This page will allow customers to find local farmers they can purchase food from. They will be able to search based on the type of food they are looking for as well as search all farmers within a given area. Once they find a potential farmer they will be able to see ratings that other customers gave them as well as reviews about the services others received.  Some Farmers will be able to offer scheduled visits to their farm and that will be viewable to the customer from the farmers calendar.  Once the customer is satisfied with the farmer they will be able to place an order a pay for it. Once the pickup is made the payment will be sent to the farmer and the customer will be prompted to leave a review.
